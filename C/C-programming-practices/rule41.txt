#### Always prefer array indexing over pointer arithmetic

If you're working with an array of things, treat them as an array. Pointer arithmetic is confusing and bug-prone. Sticking to array indexing often lets you keep the important variables constant, and only the index variables non-constant.

``` c
// Bad
for ( ; *str != '\0'; str += 1 );

// Good
for ( int i = 0; str[ i ] != '\0'; i += 1 );
```
