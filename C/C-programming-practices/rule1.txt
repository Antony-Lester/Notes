#### Always develop and compile with all warnings (and more) on

No excuses here. Always develop and compile with warnings on. It turns out, though, that `-Wall` and `-Wextra` actually don't enable "all" warnings. There are a few others that can be really helpful:

``` make
CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic \
          -Wformat=2 -Wno-unused-parameter -Wshadow \
          -Wwrite-strings -Wstrict-prototypes -Wold-style-definition \
          -Wredundant-decls -Wnested-externs -Wmissing-include-dirs

# GCC warnings that Clang doesn't provide:
ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
    CFLAGS += -Wjump-misses-init -Wlogical-op
endif
```

Compiling with optimizations on can also help to detect errors:

``` make
CFLAGS += -O2
```
