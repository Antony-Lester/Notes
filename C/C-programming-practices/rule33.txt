#### Simple constant expressions can be easier to read than variables

It can often help the readability of your code if you replace variables that are only assigned to constant expressions, with those expressions.

Consider the `trie_has` example above - the `string[ 0 ]` expression is repeated twice. It would be harder to read and follow if we inserted an extra line to define a `char` variable. It's just another thing that the readers would have to keep in mind. Many programmers of other languages wouldn't think twice about repeating an array access.
