#### Where possible, use `sizeof` on the variable; not the type

Then, if you change the type of the variable later, you only have to change it once. You'll always get the correct size.

``` c
// Good
int * a = malloc( n * ( sizeof *a ) );
```

You can't do this with compound literals, though. I think it's a worth-while trade-off to remove a variable that's only used once.

``` c
setsockopt( fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &( int ){ 1 }, ( sizeof int ) );
```
