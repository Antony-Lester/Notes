<abbr>: The Abbreviation element
The <abbr> HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.

When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.

The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.

<p>You can use <abbr>CSS</abbr> (Cascading Style Sheets) to style your <abbr>HTML</abbr> (HyperText Markup Language). Using style sheets, you can keep your <abbr>CSS</abbr> presentation layer and <abbr>HTML</abbr> content layer separate. This is called "separation of concerns."</p>
