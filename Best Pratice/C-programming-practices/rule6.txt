#### Use `//` comments everywhere, never `/* ... */`

Stick to single-line comments, and cut the complexity. Compared to single-line comments, multi-line comments:

- are rarely used with a blank margin, so they're just as character-heavy
- have a style, which has to be specified and adhered to
- often have `*/` on its own line, so they're more line-expensive
- have weird rules about embedded `/*` and `*/`
- are harder/impossible to block-edit, and to extend
- are more visually-cluttering than `//`

You have to use `/* ... */` for inline comments in multi-line `#define`s, though:

``` c
#define MAGIC( x ) \
    /* Voodoo magic happens here. */ \
    ...
```

But I often prefer to just add `//` comments after the macro body describing the tricky bits. I think this makes the macro body easier to read, but still provides the (much-needed) documentation.
