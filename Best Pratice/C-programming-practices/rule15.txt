#### Always put `const` on the right and read types right-to-left

``` c
const char * word;              // Bad: not as const-y as it can be
const char * const word;        // Bad: makes types very weird to read
char const* const word;         // Bad: weird * placement

// Good: right-to-left, word is a constant pointer to a constant char
char const * const word;
```

Because of this rule, you should always pad the `*` type qualifier with spaces.
