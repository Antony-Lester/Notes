#### Never use or provide macros that wrap control structures like `for`

Macros that loop over the elements of a data structure are extremely confusing, because they're extra-syntactic and readers can't know the control flow without looking up the definition.

To understand your program, it's crucial that your readers can understand its control flow.

Don't provide control-macros even as an option. They're universally harmful, so don't enable it. Users can define their own if they really want to.

``` c
// Bad
#define TRIE_EACH( TRIE, INDEX ) \
    for ( int INDEX = 0; INDEX < ( TRIE ).alphabet.size; INDEX += 1 )

// Not at all obvious what's actually going to happen here.
TRIE_EACH( trie, i ) {
    Trie * const child = trie.children[ i ];
    ...
}
```
