#### Prefer to return a value rather than modifying pointers

This encourages immutability, cultivates [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), and makes things simpler and easier to understand. It also improves safety by eliminating the possibility of a `NULL` argument.

``` c
// Bad: unnecessary mutation (probably), and unsafe
void drink_mix( Drink * const drink, Ingredient const ingr ) {
    assert( drink != NULL );
    color_blend( &( drink->color ), ingr.color );
    drink->alcohol += ingr.alcohol;
}

// Good: immutability rocks, pure and safe functions everywhere
Drink drink_mix( Drink const drink, Ingredient const ingr ) {
    return ( Drink ){
        .color = color_blend( drink.color, ingr.color ),
        .alcohol = drink.alcohol + ingr.alcohol
    };
}
```

This isn't always the best way to go, but it's something you should always consider.
