#### Never begin names with `_` or end them with `_t`: they're reserved for standards

[Here's a list](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Reserved-Names.html) of the names reserved by future ISO C standards. `types_like_this_t` and `_anything` are identifiers that are reserved by future standards of C, so don't use them for your own identifiers.

These kinds of names *could've* provided a nice way to tell which types are part of the language standard and which types are provided by libraries. Unfortunately, [it's](https://github.com/facebook/libphenom) [not](https://github.com/joyent/libuv) [hard](https://github.com/liuliu/ccv) to find popular C libraries and projects that make this mistake, which dilutes the helpfulness of such a rule.

This mistake is made way too often: don't make the same mistake in your library!
