#### Always use brackets, even for single-statement blocks

Always use brackets, because it's safer, easier to change, and easier to read because it's more consistent. For the same reasons, don't put a single-line statement on the same line as the condition.

What follows is actual code from *The C Programming Language*. Don't do this:

``` c
while (--argc > 0 && (*++argv)[0] == '-')
    while (c = *++argv[0])
        switch (c) {
            ...
        }
if (argc != 1)
    printf("Usage: find -x -n pattern\n");
else
    while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0) {
        ...
    }
```
