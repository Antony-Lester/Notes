#### Use `+= 1` and `-= 1` over `++` and `--`

Actually, don't use either form if you can help it. Changing state should always be avoided (within reason). But, when you have to, `+=` and `-=` are obvious, simpler and less cryptic than `++` and `--`, and useful in other contexts and with other values. Also, there are no tricks about the evaluation of `+=` and `-=` and they don't have weird twin operators to provide alternative evaluations. Python does without `++` and `--` operators, and Douglas Crockford excluded them from the Good Parts of JavaScript, because we don't need them. Sticking to this rule also encourages you to avoid changing state within an expression.
