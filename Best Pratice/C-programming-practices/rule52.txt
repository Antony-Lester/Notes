#### Give enums `UPPERCASE_SNAKE` names, and lowercase their values

Because enums are mostly just integer constants, it's natural to name them the same way as `#define`d constants. The `enum` type prefix will communicate that it expects an enum value, and the lowercase value suffixes will communicate that they aren't quite integer constants.

``` c
enum JSON_TYPE {
    JSON_TYPE_null,
    JSON_TYPE_boolean,
    JSON_TYPE_number,
    ...
};
```
