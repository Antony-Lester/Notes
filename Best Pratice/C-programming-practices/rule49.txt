#### Don't typecast unless you have to (you probably don't)

If it's valid to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type, then you don't have to cast it. You should only use typecasts when you need to, like:

- performing true division (not integer division) of `int` expressions
- making an array index an integer, but you can do this with assignment anyway
- using compound literals for structs and arrays

``` c
// This compiles fine:
struct Apple * apples = malloc( sizeof *apples );
```
